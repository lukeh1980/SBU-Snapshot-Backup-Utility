# SBU Roadmap
This is a list of features that are planned for SBU. SBU is based on scripts that were originally developed for an organization that 
needed frequent snapshots of changes to production data, only the needs of the organization were considered during that development. 
From those scripts SBU was created and features were added to make it more usable to a general audience. There are still many features
that need to be added to make this really useful for other organizations, below are planned additions.

- Options to configure permission settings of backups.
    Currently SBU does not copy over original permissions and ownership of files. Since not all storage devices make this easy to do
    options to retain permissions or not will be added soon.
- Encryption of backup files.
    Different methods of encryption are being tested and the option to encrypt backups will be added in a later release.
