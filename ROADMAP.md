# SBU Roadmap
This is a list of features that are planned for SBU. SBU is based on scripts that were originally developed for an organization that 
needed frequent snapshots of changes to production data, only the needs of the organization were considered during that development. 
From those scripts SBU was created and features were added to make it more usable to a general audience. There are still features
that need to be added to make this useful for other organizations, below are some planned improvements. I welcome any suggestions.

- Options to configure permission settings of backups. Currently SBU does not copy over original permissions and ownership of files. Since not all storage devices make this easy to do options to retain permissions or not will be added soon.
- Reconfiguring backup jobs. Options to change interval & retention settings on the fly of running jobs are planned. 
- Encryption of backup files. Different methods of encryption are being tested and the option to encrypt backups will be added in a later release.
