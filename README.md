# SBU (Snapshot Backup Utility)
SBU is a command line snapshot backup utility for linux that utilizes hard links and rsync to generate snapshots. It is written using only rsync and bash so it should be very portable among Linux distributions. It was written on a Rasberry Pi 2 and was successfully tested taking snapshots every minute on a small directory however its intended use was to take snapshots every 30 minutes of a heavily active directory structure consisting of about 1 million files (mostly office documents) and a total size of about 600 GB. SBU should work on larger data stores but the snapshot time will depend on number of files, changes, size etc. You can have as many backup jobs going at different intervals as your system resources will allow but each backup job should be unique.

Due to the use of hard links SBU requires the destination file system to be Linux based but not the source directory. There is no GUI interface but there are plans for a web interface in the future. Encryption of destination directories are also planned for a future release.
