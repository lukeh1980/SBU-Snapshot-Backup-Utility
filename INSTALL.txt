# AUTO INSTALLATION VIA INSTALL-SBU.SH

***This installation script should be ran on a fresh install of Linux, SBU has been tested on CentOS/RHEL 6/7 and Ubuntu Server 16/17.***

Follow these steps to install SBU using the install-sbu.sh script:

(1) Download the tar file named sbu-x.x.x-install.tar and extract it on your Linux system.
	
	wget http://snapshotbackuputility.com/media/sbu-x.x.x-install.tar (Or it may be downloaded from github: https://github.com/lukeh1980/Snapshot-Backup-Utility) 
    tar -xaf sbu-x.x.x-install.tar
  
(2) Change directory to extracted folder:

    cd sbu-x.x.x

(3) You will find 4 files: sbu-x.x.x.tar, install-sbu.sh, uninstall-sbu.sh, and upgrade-sbu.sh (upgrade-sbu.sh is experimental, it may not work properly). CHMOD scripts to be executable:

    chmod +x ./*.sh
	
(4) Run install-sbu.sh:

    ./install-sbu.sh

NOTE: install-sbu.sh will check for all packages that are needed and if they are not installed it will install them. 
The system package manager will be used for all packages with the exception of rsync version 3.1.2, SBU cannot run without this version of rsync installed.
The installation script will download and build this version of rsync from samba.

WARNING: If you already have an older rsync package installed via a package manager installing rsync 3.1.2 with this script may
cause a conflict.

# MANUAL INSTALLATION

NOTE: This assumes a fresh install of CentOS/RHEL 6/7 or Ubuntu 16/17. This also assumes you know how to complete the tasks below without explanation.
If you are uncomfortable with the below steps please use the install-sbu.sh script as it accomplishes the same tasks.

(1) Install Dependencies:

	SBU requires these packages to be installed:

	gcc (required for rsync installation)
	make (required for rsync installation)
	perl (required for rsync installation)
	psmisc (required for SBU)
	
	Next you will need to download and install rsync 3.1.2 from https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/src/rsync-3.1.2.tar.gz

	After successfully installing the above packages as well as rsync 3.1.2 you are then ready to proceed with the SBU installation.

(2) Install SBU:

	First create these directories:
		
		/opt/sbu
		/opt/sbu/jobs
		/opt/sbu/delqueue
		/var/log/sbu
	
	Download the repository here: https://github.com/lukeh1980/Snapshot-Backup-Utility.
	
	Copy or extract all files in the SOURCE directory into /opt/sbu.
  
  Make all files in /opt/sbu/source executable as well as the /opt/sbu file.
	
	If using CentOS/RHEL 6 then you will need to add this line to /etc/rc.local and make sure it's executable (it should run with sudo privileges or as root):
		
		/bin/bash /opt/sbu/source/autostart.sh
		
	If you are using Ubuntu 16/17 or CentOS/RHEL 7 then you will need to create a Unit file for systemd, an example for sbu.service is below:
		
		[Unit]
		Description = SBU
		After = network.target
		[Service]
		Type = forking
		ExecStart = /opt/sbu/source/autostart.sh
		[Install]
		WantedBy = multi-user.target
		
	Reload, enable, and start sbu.service:
		
		systemctl daemon-reload
		systemctl enable sbu.service
		systemctl start sbu.service
		
	Finally update your PATH variable by adding :/opt/sbu to ~/.bashrc and execute exec bash to refresh.
	
	You should now have SBU installed and ready to create jobs. Run sbu --help for basic instructions.
  
  NOTE: SBU should run as root or with sudo privileges, it may not function properly otherwise.
