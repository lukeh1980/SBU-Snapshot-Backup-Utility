<p>SBU is meant to be an easy to use Linux command line utility for creating automated snapshots of data directories allowing the recovery of data at different points in time. It is written using only shell scripts and rsync so it should run on most Linux distributions. You can run as many backup jobs as your system resources will allow but each backup job must be unique. SBU can run on lightweight computers (It was developed on a Raspberry Pi 2) but large directory structures will require more processing power to take frequent snapshots.</p>

<p>SBU makes use of hard links to generate lightweight snapshots, syncing only files that have changed. It is meant to be a flexible utility that can be used on it's own or as a foundation for other backup systems. It was originally developed to mitigate against ransomware style attacks when rapid recovery of data in it's most recent form is critical to the stability of a business. SBU can help provide a business with a secure and protected location of recent, or even near-realtime* backups to make the restoration of data quick and painless.</p>

<p>SBU can also protect against accidental deletion or corruption of critical data and provide a version history of individual files for recovery at previous points in time.</p>

<p>*SBU can be configured to take snapshots of changes every couple seconds however the directory and file size will determine the minimum interval time.</p>
