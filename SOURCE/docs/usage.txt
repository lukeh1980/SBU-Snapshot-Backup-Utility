Version 0.3.6

SBU (Snapshot Backup Utility) makes an initial full copy to the /destination/backup-name/snapshots/backup-name.full directory.
Snapshots are created by hard linking the previous snapshots to the next snapshot directory and then syncing any changed files from the previous interval.
In this way it creates historical snapshots of data. Multiple backup jobs can be run simultaneously and at different intervals but must have unique sources, destinations & names.

By default full sync is set to on, this will cause SBU to delete files that have been deleted on the source at each interval. This may result in longer snapshot times if files are deleted frequently, 
to speed up snapshots you can set full sync to off. This will cause deleted files to remain in snapshots until midnight when a full sync is done each night. 
	
NOTE: For very large directories initialization may take a long time while it makes a full file copy of data. If the initialization process is interrupted
sbu will try to restart the initialization over the next time the job starts. 

OPTIONS SUMMARY

-c, --create		name of backup (should be unique to sbu jobs)
-s, --source		directory to be backed up	
-d, --destination	directory where backup snapshots are to be stored	
-i, --interval		interval in minutes that snapshots should be taken	
-r, --retention		number of days to keep snapshots before rolling into base snapshot

--status		displays status of backup jobs, optionally takes backup name as parameter (tip: use "watch sbu --status" to view status live)
--stop			stops backup job, will restart after reboot if autostart is on
--start			starts backup job that has been stopped
--restart		restarts backup job
--autostart		sets autostart to on or off, use --name option: sbu --autostart on --name my-backup-job
--full-sync		sets full sync on or off, use --name option: sbu --full-sync on --name my-backup-job
--set-interval		sets new interval, use --name option: sbu --set-interval 10 --name my-backup-job
--set-retention		sets new retention policy, use --name option: sbu --set-retention 30 --name my-backup-job
--remove		takes backup name as parameter and removes the backup job, will ask to delete backup files
--force			forces delete of backup files without prompting
--reinit		reinitializes the backup job. WARNING: This command destructive, it will delete all previous backups and start over.			

USAGE EXAMPLE:

	sbu --create my-backup --source /directory/to/backup --dest /destination/to/save/backups --interval 30 --retention 30

USAGE NOTES: 

	- Enclose directory names with spaces in double quotes: "/my directory/with a space"
	- Do not use trailing slashes at the end of source and destination directories.
	- Do not use spaces in backup job names.

FILESYSTEM NOTES:
	SBU relies on hardlinks to generate snapshots so you must use a filesystem that supports hard links as your destination directory. NFS shares should work fine as well as any Linux based filesystems.
